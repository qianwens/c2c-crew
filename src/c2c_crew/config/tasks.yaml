file_structure_analyze_task:
  description: >
    Review the code file structure in {folder} to identify the services' main project folder with the project programming language, main code files, configuration files, and dependency files.
    Main code files are the files that contain the main functions of the service or contains the files that initialize the service dependencies.
    You should use your expertise to reasoning based on the file structure and the file name.
  expected_output: >
    A list of services with the main project folder, the programming language, the full path of main code files, the full path of configuration files, and the full path of dependency files.
  agent: code_analyst

service_code_analyze_task:
  description: >
    Review the service's main code files {mainFiles} to identify the main functions of the service.
    Generate a service name and description based on the main functions.
  expected_output: >
    An object with the service name and description.
  agent: code_analyst

environment_variables_detect_task:
  description: >
    Review the service's configuration files {configFiles} and main source code files {mainFiles} to identify the environment variables needed to run the service.
  expected_output: >
    A list of environment variables with the key name, description, and default value.
  agent: code_analyst

dependencies_detect_task:
  description: >
    Review the service's main code files {mainFiles} and dependency files {dependencyFiles} to identify the dependent services needed to run the service.
  expected_output: >
    A list of dependent services with the service name, service type.
  agent: code_analyst

dependencies_analyze_task:
  description: >
    Given the dependent service list and the environment variables, analyze the dependent services to identify the required environment variables for each service.
  expected_output: >
    A list of dependent services with the service name and required environment variables.
  agent: code_analyst

error_code_search_task:
  description: >
    Given the code search rule, search the code base to identify the code that might cause the error.
  expected_output: >
    Code snippet and the line number of the error code.
  agent: code_analyst

azure_services_recommend_task:
  description: >
    Given the service types, recommend azure services that can be used to implement the services.
  expected_output: >
    A list of services with the service name and the recommended azure service type.
  agent: azure_architect

error_message_analyze_task:
  description: >
    Review the error message to identify the error type, the potential reason and how to search the code for the error.
  expected_output: >
    An report of the error message, the root cause, and the code search rule.
